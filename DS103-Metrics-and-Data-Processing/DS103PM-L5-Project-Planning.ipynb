    "Project planning is the process that captures the big picture view of your project. Unlike Scrum and Kanban which are concerned with the small details of specific tasks that need to be completed, a project plan views the project in terms of whole features.\n",

    "## Gantt Charts\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to predict the future is very difficult, so it helps to break down the thing you are predicting into smaller parts. A Gantt chart is a way of seeing all your smaller pieces put together in a timeline so that you can see who is working on what and when.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Gantt chart. It has several bars on it going horizontally. There is a date bar across the top. Each of the bars has a different length and some of them overlap with each other on the date bar.](media/gantt-chart.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Gantt charts are popular for their ability to see where tasks overlap. In the above screenshot, if different people are working on the top 3 tasks, that is ok because those are all done in parallel. If one person is supposed to be doing all of those your project probably has a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another aspect of Gantt charts that is helpful is that you can generally express the dependencies between tasks. In the above screenshot, tasks with the triple dots either follow or precede another task. By defining how tasks relate to each other, it's possible to determine the minimum possible time for part of your project to be complete. It's also easier in this style to spot a task that is depended on by multiple other tasks. Failure to make progress on that single task effectively blocks many other tasks. This is a crucial thing to identify in your project since you'll almost always want to divert resources to make sure a task with many dependencies finishes on time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequence of tasks that have the potential to block others is the critical path for your project. There is no way to complete the project sooner than the time it takes to do those tasks plus any that follow since those following tasks are dependent on it. Identifying your critical path helps you target the high-risk tasks early and give you a much better chance that your project stays on schedule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gantt charts are not the only tool you should use for managing your project but is an important one at the overall project level. Gantt charts allow you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- See when tasks will be started relative to each other\n",
    "- See who is allocated to which tasks so you can make sure no individual is needed on two things at the same time\n",
    "- See if one task is ever blocked waiting for another to continue\n",

    "The tool you will use to illustrate the idea of a project plan is **[Liquid Planner](https://liquidplanner.com)**. It is not a tool for tracking bugs or small tasks, but helps you see the big picture of your project. It is especially good for answering \"what if\" questions since it can recalculate your estimated completion date automatically and adjust your timelines as you adjust priorities. Not all Gantt chart systems have this capability, and for some scenarios, it is not even something you would want to happen.\n",

    "\n",
    "The grey bar that appears on top of the timelines for `Lesson 1` - `Lesson 3` indicates an interruption from another task or event. In this case, it is the holiday of Labor Day. This pushes the completion date of those three lessons back 1 day. Liquid can account for holiday or vacation days and adjusts your estimated completion date automatically.

    "\n",
    "As you can see, the estimated completion date has shifted to be earlier. It is now September 17th instead of September 24th. Lesson 4 is now in line with Lessons 1 - 3 as it is not blocked by DavidK working on Lesson 1 first.
