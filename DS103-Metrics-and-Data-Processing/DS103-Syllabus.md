# DS103 Metrics and Data Processing

Course Description: The Metrics and Data Processing course will prepare students to be able to create new metrics that directly answer or monitor business questions.  This module will also teach the theory and practice of statistical process control.  Upon completion of this module, students will be equipped to help businesses monitor their processes and know when a process is out of control and needs to be fixed.
