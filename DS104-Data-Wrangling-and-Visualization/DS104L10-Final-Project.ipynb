    "The data file attached above is a subset of crash data from Texas in 2013. The entire file has over 500,000 rows. What you are seeing here is about 1% of those rows, selected randomly. Your assignment for this project is to create visualizations using these data. As you do this, take into account which columns are what kind of data. For instance, the ```Crash_ID``` column looks like a number, but in reality it is a categorical variable. Doing math on the numbers doesn't really make any sense. There are many, many columns that are coded with numbers, so not only do they not make any sense, they are also categorical.\n",

Lots of people think data mining is the process of dumping a large dataset into some sort of tool, and having it spit out all kinds of findings. This is not the case. Most data mining is done by hand. It is like having a big mess of string somewhere, and grabbing the end of one piece of string. When you pull it, you will find out where it goes. If this exercise is boring and mundane to you, you might be traveling down the wrong path. It is likely that the Texas Department of Transportation is either paying someone to sift through these data to make actionable discoveries, or they wish they had someone who could do it.</p>\n",
