# Presentation Structure
Your completed project should be in a presentation format and will be presented to the instructors recorded so that you can showcase with any future audience consisting of current and former students, instructors, mentors, administrators, and potential employers.
Your presentation should be upwards of 30 minutes, and plan for 5-10 minutes for questions at the end. Resist the urge to cram every single thing into your presentation; instead, hit the big "Ah-ha" moments. You are likely to have a lot of analyses that are inconclusive or uninteresting, so you don't need to include all of them. If employers are strongly interested in you, they'll check out your GitHub account and get all the details. But including too much detail in a big picture overview presentation can make things boring and doesn't demonstrate you have summarization skills.
Your goal is to demonstrate to your audience those analytics can improve decision making. Don't make them jump to conclusions on their own - walk them up to each important finding you want to highlight and provide a summary of all graphs and findings that are one sentence or less and provided in plain English.
You should be prepared to give a high-level overview of your project, and your presentation should be divided into the following sections:
-	Title Slide
-	Your Background
-	Project Introduction / Background
-	Methods
-	Results
-	Summary
-	Conclusions
-	Questions

You can switch to Jupyter Lab for a demonstration of your analytical examples but donâ€™t dwell too long on it. You should then switch back to your presentation for summary, conclusions and for taking questions.

 
# Title Slide
The title slide is where you will introduce your project. You should give your project a catchy name and should list the names of the team below. Team member names should be listed in alphabetical order.
 
# Your Background
Next, you should have a slide for each team member that covers your background. Talk about your previous education, employment, or subject matter expertise. Tell folks where you are currently or were last employed.
 
# Project Introduction / Background
You should have a couple slides of background information about the topic you are covering. For instance, if you are asking and answering questions about the stock market, you should give a little basic information about the stock market. Try to build this up, so start with the most general information and then get more specific with information that directly relates to your data or the questions you will be answering with the data.
 
# Methods
Next comes your methods section. This is where you talk about all of the details regarding your data. You want to give a very high level overview of what you did to:
-	Gather/find data
-	Manipulate / wrangle data
-	Create new variables
You also want to paint a picture of what your data is like. Include details such as:
-	Important variables and their summary statistics
-	Sample size
The methods section should only be a few slides, and should not include any code. You are presenting to a wide, non-data science audience, and thus should not go into a lot of detail.
 
# Results
The results section will be the meat of your presentation. You should divide your results section into parts by evaluation question, so that you can easily signpost things. In the results section, you will go over any of the exploratory findings you have you want to discuss, as well as the answers to each evaluation question. Ensure that you provide LOTS of beautiful visuals to go along with your findings.
 
# Summary
The summary should be JUST ONE SLIDE, and it should contain a summary of the entirety of your results section. It should be in layman's terms, quick and dirty.
 
# Conclusions
Your conclusion section should also only be one slide long. In it, you should have some bullet points containing information about:
-	How do your findings impact the world at large?
-	What's important about this work?
-	Big picture information
 
# Questions
Your presentation should conclude with a questions slide. All it needs to say is "Questions?" and it helps signify the end of the presentation and the beginning of the question-and-answer section of your big day. You should be prepared for questions like these:
-	If you had more time, what else would you do on this project?
-	What's next for you?
-	What was the most difficult part of this project?
