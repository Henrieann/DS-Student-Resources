The other important feature to note here is the last checkbox at the bottom, for ```Strings as factors```. Most of the time, it is a good idea to leave this checked, as it will turn your character data into a categorical variable that can be used for most analyses.  However, a few commands need to be done with strings only, so if you come up with errors, you may need to re-import without this check mark.\n",

    "# Manipulating Data\n",
    "\n",
    "One of R's strengths is the ability to manipulate data to facilitate statistical analysis and to extract meaning and information from the data. Consider the following types of manipulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Filtering:** Selecting a subset of observations that meet specific criteria from a data frame.\n",
    "* **Ordering:** Arranging the observations in a data frame into a particular order according to given criteria.\n",
    "* **Selection:** Choosing certain variables from a data frame.\n",
    "* **Mutation:** Computing new variables from variables that already exist in the data frame.\n",
    "* **Grouping:** Creating groups of observations that have given common characteristics.\n",
    "* **Summarizing:** Describing observations using sample statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The base R language has sophisticated functions that will perform each of these manipulations. Unfortunately, like many things in the base R language, learning to use these functions effectively can be frustrating, difficult, and time consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, instead of using the base R language functions, you will be introduced and use the ```dplyr``` package to manipulate data.

As with the ```mutate()``` function, the term on the left side of the equals sign gives the name of the column to be created; you are creating something called ```ave_age```. The term on the right of the equals sign is the function to be applied.  In this case, you are applying the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the output of ```summarize()``` is only one row, because it computed the mean of all the rows in the data frame.  It is only one column, too: the value computed by the summary.\n",

    "# Combining Group By and Summarize\n",

    "# Grouping Data Grouped by Factors\n",
    "\n",
    "A structure like a data frame allows you to group data by factors to determine what effect the factors have on the data. To illustrate this, you will use the ```morley``` data set that is built into R. The data in this data set are the values of the speed of light measured by Michelson in 1879.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data were collected in five experiments; in each experiment, the speed of light was measured 20 times. Each measurement is called a ```Run```. The measured value was the speed of light in km/sec; in the morley data set, 299000 is subtracted from the measured value.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see the first several rows in this data set with the command ```head(morley)```. This gives:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Expt Run Speed  \n",
    "\n",
    "001 1 1 850  \n",
    "\n",
    "002 1 2 740  \n",
    "\n",
    "003 1 3 900  \n",
    "\n",
    "004 1 4 1070  \n",
    "\n",
    "005 1 5 930  \n",
    "\n",
    "006 1 6 850\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can also see view it in your Data Pane. ```Expt``` is the number of the experiment, ```Run``` is the number of the specific measurement, and ```Speed``` is the measured value.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create a box plot of this data, grouped by ```Expt```, using the following command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ggplot(morley, aes(x = Expt, y = Speed)) + geom_boxplot(aes(group=Expt))\n",
    "```\n",
    "```x``` will be the variable you are grouping by, and ```y``` will be the continuous variable to look at. Then you'll specify your grouping variable again in ```(aes(group=)```. These commands give the following box plot: \n",
    "\n",
    "![A boxplot for morley dataframe, grouped by Expt. The x-axis on the bottom reads Expt. The y-axis on the left reads Speed. Experiment 1 and 3 show outliers.](Media/L06-SpeedBoxPlot.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The argument ```aes(group=Expt)``` tells R to group the data by experiment. All the speed values from Experiment 1 (in other words, each of the speed values from a row in which Expt is equal to 1) are used to create the leftmost box plot. Similarly, all the speed values from Experiment 2 are used to create the next box plot, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the mean speed for each experiment using the ```group_by()``` and ```summarize()``` functions as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "morley %>% group_by(Expt) %>% summarize(m.speed = mean(Speed))\n",

    "# Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "From here on out, most of the data you will work with in R will be stored in data frames or tibbles, as those frameworks are easily fed into statistical analyses. In data frames, the variables are the columns, and the observations are known as the rows. However, to analyze the exact data you want, you may have to manipulate it some, which is where the ```dplyr``` package comes in. Using ```dplyr```, you can filter down to only the data or variables you're interested in, easily summarize and group data, and even create new variables using ```mutate()```.\n",
