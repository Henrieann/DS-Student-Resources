    "# Hypothesis Tests on the Mean\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the difficulties of learning statistics and analysis is that there is a bewildering array of hypothesis tests; each one applies to slightly different circumstances. They are all useful and important, but it can be a real trial trying to figure out which test applies to your particular data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will use R to implement hypothesis tests for the following circumstances:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Single Sample *t*-test: Testing the mean of a single population\n",
    ">Based on a sample, is the mean of a population equal to a value or not equal to a value?\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Independent *t*-test: Testing the mean of two populations \n",
    ">Based on two samples, are the means of two populations equal to each other?\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Dependent *t*-test: Testing the mean of two populations using paired data\n",
    ">Based on two samples, where each observation in one sample is related to a specific observation in the other sample, are the means of the two populations equal to each other?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## T-test for One Sample\n",
    "\n",
    "You will start with scenario one: testing the mean of a single population. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the ```t.test()``` function to perform a hypothesis test on the mean. Recall that to perform a hypothesis test, you create a null hypothesis and then determine if your data give you evidence to reject the null hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, you will use the **[frostedflakes data set](https://repo.exeterlms.com/documents/V2/DataScience/Stat-Prog-R/frostedflakes.zip)**. Import this data, and then you should now be able to access the ```frostedflakes``` dataset:\n",

    "\n",
    "According to the nutritional information supplied with Frosted Flakes, the sugar percentage by weight is 37%. You will create a hypothesis test to see if the data set provides evidence to the contrary. To set up the hypothesis test, define the null and alternate hypotheses as follows:\n",

    "![H sub zero, mu equals thirty seven. H sub one, mu does not equal thirty seven.](Media/L08-OnePopH.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will now see if your data provide evidence that you should reject the null hypothesis by using a *t*-test. In R, you will use the following commands: \n",
    "\n",

    "t_obj <- t.test(frostedflakes$Lab, mu = 37)\n",
    "print(t_obj)\n",

    "You will save the object returned by ```t.test()``` in the variable ```t_obj```, then print this object.  The arguments for ```t.test()``` are the name of the dataset, ```frostedflakes```, followed by the variable you are testing in the dataset ```Lab```, followed by the argument ```mu=```.  Remember that mu is the population mean, so it is the number you want to test against.  In this case, you want to see if the sample sugar percentage is 37% or not, so that will be your ```mu=``` value here. This code yields the following output:\n",

    "\n",
    "alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 37\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The second line confirms that you have set up the test correctly: the alternate hypothesis is that mu, the true mean, is not equal to 37. The first line gives you a lot of information. The first part tells you that the *t*-score computed using the hypothesized mean of 37 is 2.4155.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last part gives you the *p*-value for this test: 0.01755. The *p*-value is an indication of whether the data provide evidence that you should reject the null hypothesis. The smaller the *p*-value, the stronger the evidence that you should reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, data scientists compare the *p*-value to a threshold of 0.05 to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis; in this case, the *p*-value is 0.01755, which is smaller than 0.05, so you should reject the null hypothesis. You have decided that the percentage of sugar in frosted flakes is not equal to 37%.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that the mean of the measured values is 37.596 gives you some evidence that the percentage of sugar is somewhat higher than 37%.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also see a graphical interpretation of this test. In the plot below, there is a histogram of the data with the 95% confidence interval computed by ```t.test()``` in red; you also show the value of mu for the null hypothesis in green. You've seen the first three lines of the code below before; it's standard for histograms.  But the last three lines are new.  The function ```geom_vline()``` plots vertical lines on the graph, and they are plotted at values of the ```xintercept=``` argument.  You can pull these directly from the ```t.test()``` function by providing the object name followed by the name of the information in the ```t.test()``` output.  ```conf.int[1]``` is the lower confidence level, ```conf.int[2]``` is the upper confidence level, and ```null.value``` is the mean. \n",

    "```{r}\n",

    "d + geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +\n",
    "geom_vline(xintercept = t_obj$conf.int[1], color = \"red\") +\n",

    "geom_vline(xintercept = t_obj$null.value, color = \"green\")\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that the value of mu for the null hypotheses (which is 37) is not in the 95% confidence interval. Roughly speaking, this indicates that the probability that 37 is the true value of the mean is lower than 5%. This tells you that you have strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis, which states that the true value of the mean is 37.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using the *t*-test, it is always a good idea to check to see if your data have an approximate normal distribution. You can check to see if the ```Lab``` variable in the ```frostedflakes``` data set is normal by creating the normal probability plot for it:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The data fall pretty much on a straight line, so you can conclude that they come from a normal distribution and the hypothesis test is built on solid assumptions.  This can also be seen in the histogram above; it looks approximately bell shaped.\n",

    "\n",
    "You will use the frosted flakes data again. Suppose you now want to determine if the measurements made by the IA-400 give us the same average values as the lab measurements. To do this, you will think of the measurements in the data set as coming from two populations: one population is the lab measurements, and the other is the IA-400 measurements. \n",

    "The null hypothesis is that the two sample means are equal, and the alternative hypothesis is that the two sample means differ.  This is a two-sided *t*-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use ```t.test()``` to create a test on the two sample means; in this case, each sample is an argument to ```t_test()```. As before, you save the object returned by ```t.test()``` into a variable ( this one is named ```t_ind```), then print that object. There  are two other arguments included in ```t.test()``` as well.  The first is ```alternative=```.  Your options are ```\"two.sided\"``` for a two-tailed hypothesis test, or ```\"greater\"``` and ```\"less\"``` for a one-tailed test, each for the particular direction you are hypothesizing for the one-tailed test.  The last argument is ```var.equal=``` and the options for this are only ```TRUE``` or ```FALSE```.  This is very similar to the different independent *t* test options you receive in MS Excel; one type is for when you have homogeneity, or equal, variance, and the other is for when you have heterogeneous (unequal) variance.

When you did this for the ```frostedflakes``` dataset, there were only two columns, so R had no confusion about which two to move around.  But here, with the added variable of ```Student.Number```, you need to let R know that you want to fill the variable column with ```pretest``` and ```postest```.

    "![A histogram. The x axis is labeled difference between postest and pretest and runs from zero to approximately eighteen. The y axis is labeled count and runs from zero to six. Vertical bars of various heights are plotted.](Media/L08-HistScores.png)\n",

    "\n",
    "*t*-tests are quite handy for when your sample size is relatively small and you are looking to determine a difference between means.  The type of *t*-test depends on the means you want to compare.  If you are comparing a sample to a population mean, then choose a single sample *t*-test.  If you are comparing two unrelated samples, then choose an independent *t*-test.  And if you are comparing two related samples, then you'll want to chose a dependent *t*-test. \n",
    "\n",
    "R makes *t*-testing so very easy with the function ```t.test()```, which can handle all three types. It also provides you with means and confidence intervals for your *t*-tests, which is a big help.   \n",
