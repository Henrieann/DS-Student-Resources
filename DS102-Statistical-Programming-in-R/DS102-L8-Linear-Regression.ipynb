    "\n",
    "In R, creating a scatter plot is relatively simple. In this lesson, you will use ```ggplot2``` to create scatter plots as well. If you have closed R since last using ```ggplot2```, remember that you will need to load it by using the following command at the beginning of every RStudio session: \n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "library(ggplot2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You could also click the check box next to ```gggplot2``` in the ```Packages``` tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will start by creating a scatter plot using the ```faithful``` data set; you will plot eruption times verses waiting times, with ```eruptions``` on the horizontal axis, or ```x=``` axis, and ```waiting``` on the vertical, or ```y=``` axis:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "d <- ggplot(faithful, aes(x = eruptions, y = waiting))\n",
    "d + geom_point()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These commands produce the following scatter plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "![A scatterplot. The x axis is labeled eruptions and runs from one point five to approximately five point two five. The y axis is labeled waiting and runs from forty to one hundred. Data points are scattered and are mostly clustered in the bottom left and the upper right portions.](Media/L07-ScatterPlot.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add a title and improve the axis labels using the ```ggtitle()```, ```xlab()```, and ```ylab()``` functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "d + geom_point() + ggtitle(\"Old Faithful Eruption vs Waiting Times\") +\n",

    "\n",
    "* A short eruption time followed by a short wait until the next eruption\n",
    "* A long eruption time followed by a long wait. \n",
    "\n",
    "After having created a scatter plot, you may want to see how well the data fit a straight line. You can do this easily in ```ggplot2``` with the additional function of adding in ```+ geom_smooth()``` and specifying as an argument to ```geom_smooth()``` that you want the method, or shape of line, to be ```lm```.  ```lm``` stands for *linear model*.  A linear model will create a straight line on the graph.\n",

    "\n",
    "In addition to the line that fits the data, the ```geom_smooth()``` function adds a grey area around the line. In this image, it may be a little difficult to see, because it does not expand much past the blue line.  It is easiest to see at the beginning and the end of the line, where there is a little contrast with all the black dots.  This grey shading is called the *confidence region*. Roughly speaking, if the boundaries of the region are close to the line, it indicates that you are confident in the accuracy of your estimates of the parameters that define the line; if the region extends away from the line, it indicates that you are less confident in the accuracy of the line.  You can think of the grey shading as like the margin of error. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you didn't want your graph to include the grey shading, however, it can easily be turned off with the argument ```se=false```: \n",
    "\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "d + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=lm, se=FALSE)\n",
    "```\n",

You will use the ```method=``` argument to specify ```\"pearson\"``` if you have two continuous variables that are normally distributed.  If, however, you have two continuous variables that are NOT normally distributed (this is called *non-parametric*), then you will use the argument ```\"spearman\"```, which will conduct the non-parametric correlation *Spearman's Rho*, pronounced \"row.\" If you had two categorical variables that are numeric or have been recoded to numeric, then you can make use of the argument ```\"kendall\"```, which conducts the test *Kendall's Tau*, pronounced like \"ow!\" with a \"t\" on the front, or the beginning of \"tower.\" \n",

This can easily be done with subsetting.  You are telling R that out of the ```mtcars``` data frame, you want to keep all the rows (if you wanted to keep certain rows, those numbers would go before the comma), and that you want to keep only the first seven columns in the data frame.  You'll name this new truncated dataset ```mtcars_quant```. \n",

In the process of computing the parameters of the line, you can also determine how well the line fits your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Simple linear regression*, which you will learn here, is when there are only two variables. It is possible to do linear regression with more than two variables; this is called *multiple linear regression*, and you'll dive into it later.  When you compute a linear regression, you are actually computing the equation of the line that best fits the data.\n",

    "* **y:** Variable on the vertical axis.\n",
    "* **m:** The slope of the line; indicates how steep the angle of the line is.\n",
    "* **b:** The intercept of the line; where the line crosses the y axis.\n",

    "If you know the slope and intercept of the line, then you can compute the y value of any point on the line from its x value. (You can also, with some algebra, compute the x value of any point on the line from its y value.) So when you say that the linear regression computes the parameters of the line that best fits your data, you are saying that the linear regression computes the slope and the intercept of the line.\n",

    "The first thing you will want to look for is the ```F-statistic``` and ```p-value```, at the very bottom.  These tell you if the overall model is significant.  What is meant by that? If the overall model is significant, it means that your x value (or x values, in the case of multiple regression) are a significant predictor of your y value. If the the *p* value isn't significant at *p* < .05 at the very least, then the rest of the output really isn't worth looking at.  You didn't find anything interesting to talk about or report!\n",

    "\n",
    "Luckily, speed is a significant predictor of stopping distance, since the *p* value is quite small; much smaller than .05. So, you can go on to look at the rest of the output. You'll next want to glance at the ```Coefficients``` section.  In the ```Coefficients``` section, you can find the information provided with the ```print()``` function above, under the column header ```Estimate```. The first row is the intercept and the second row labeled ```speed``` is the slope. Those are the values you would plug into your equation, just like before.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The other important part of this ```Coefficients``` table is ```t value``` and ```Pr(>|t|)``` sections, for everything but the ```Intercept```.  Because you only had one x variable, since you are doing simple linear regression, that is the only thing besides ```Intercept``` listed.  But if you were doing multiple regression, there would be multiple x variables and thus multiple rows of data after ```Intercept```. R conducts a *t*-test on each individual predictor of y, to see if it contributes anything to the prediction model. The ``Pr(>|t|)``` section is the *p* value for this *t*-test, and if it is significant, than you know that the x variable has an impact on the y variable.  So, speed is a significant predictor of stopping distance according to the *t* test as well.  Since there was only one x variable, you expect the *F*-test results to match the *t*-test results, in that they should both be significant.  That is the case here as well: both *F* and *t* are significant. \n",

These both mean the same thing, but the second one is adjusted for the number of variables in the model, in order to reduce the amount of Type I error that may abound. As a general rule, looking at ```Adjusted R-squared``` is the more prudent thing to do. The R-squared value is also called the *coefficient of determination*. It is a measure of the percentage of the variability of the data set that the line explains. In this case, because the Adjusted R-squared value is 0.6438, the line explains approximately 64% of the variability of the data. Put another way, this means that speed is able to explain about 64% of the factors that go into stopping distance.  The rest is covered by other variables that have not been included in the model. The larger the R-Squared value, the more closely related the variables in the model are.\n",

For example, suppose you want to know the stopping distance for a 1920's vehicle traveling at 21 miles per hour.

In the image below, to find the predicted stopping distance at 21 miles per hour, you go up from the x axis at a value of 21 until you reach the regression line.

No, because there is variability in the relationship between speed and stopping distance.

    "\n",
    "When you have two continuous variables, analyses like *t*-tests won't work.  Instead, you'll use correlation to determine the relationship between variables, or simple linear regression to determine causality and/or predict y values.  An ideal visualization for two continuous variables is a scatterplot with a best fit line; it allows you to visually assess a correlation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Correlations can be assessed by both their strength (ranging from 0- 1) and their direction (positive or negative).  A positive correlation has both variables varying in the same direction, while a negative correlation has the variables varying in opposite directions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regressions can be used to predict values, and thus is often called *predictive modeling*. A line is created using the equation y=mx + b, which takes into account m, the slope, and b, the y intercept.  Luckily, R calculates these values for you. \n",

Use this information to answer the below questions. This Hands-On will **not** be graded, but you are encouraged to complete it. The best way to become a great Data Scientist is to practice! Please write your answers within an R Script file, and submit your project in the below area. \n",
