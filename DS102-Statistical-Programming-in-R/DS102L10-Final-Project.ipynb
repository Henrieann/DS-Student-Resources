You should document your exploration in an R script file, and by creating a PowerPoint (or equivalent) presentation that includes the following elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  R code that you use at each step.\n",
    "-  Plots that you create with your R code.\n",

    "In the process of completing this project, you will want to save your plots to files so you can add them to your PowerPoint presentation. You can do this in R-Studio as follows: After you have created the plot, click the `Export` button at the top of the Plots pane. Then click on the `Save as Image...` menu. This brings up a dialog box in which you can choose the image format, the directory (folder) in which the image will be saved, and the name of the image file.\n",
