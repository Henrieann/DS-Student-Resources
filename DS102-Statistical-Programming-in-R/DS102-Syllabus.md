## Required Resources: 
- Ground-based students are required to bring a late model laptop computer (either PC or MacBook) to class every day.  

- Online students are required to have a late model laptop or desktop computer with internet access.  

- Minimum: PC (Windows 10/11) or Mac (Big Sur or Monterey) laptop. 8GB ram, 512GB HD, Intel Core i5,  AMD Ryzen 5, or Apple Intel or M1 Chipsets.

- Recommended: PC (Windows 10/11) or Mac laptop(Big Sur or Monterey). 16GB ram, 1TB SSD, Intel Core i7, AMD Ryzen 7, or Apple M1/M1 Pro Chipsets.

- Professionals: PC (Windows 10/11) or Mac(Big Sur or Monterey). 32-64 GB ram, 2-8TB SSD, Intel Core i9, AMD Ryzen 9/Threadripper, or Apple M1 Max Chipsets.

- It is a requirement that you are able to download programming resources to your laptop/desktop for this class. (This means you need a steady internet high bandwidth connection.)

- You are required to have a quiet place to study and to be able to focus on the material.

- You are required to have uninterrupted weekly 1:1 video meetings with your mentor.

- You are required to log into the Learning Management System (LMS) daily for at least 20 minutes.

- Please follow and review each lesson page by page coding examples provided as this will ensure you have a full understanding for your final hands-on assignments.
