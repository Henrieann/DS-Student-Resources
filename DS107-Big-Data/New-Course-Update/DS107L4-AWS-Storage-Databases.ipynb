The data that you store in Amazon S3 is not associated with any particular server, and you do not need to manage any infrastructure yourself. You can put as many objects into S3 as you want. Amazon S3 holds trillions of objects, and regularly peaks at millions of requests per second. Objects can be almost any data file, such as images, videos, or server logs. You can fine-grained control over who can access you data by using AWS Identity and Access Management policies, Amazon S3 bucket policies, and even per object access control lists. By default, none of your data is shared publicly. You can also encrypt your data in transit and and at rest by enabling server-side encryption. Amazon S3 includes event notifications that enable you to set up automatic notifications when certain events occur, such as when an object is uploaded to a bucket or deleted from a specific bucket. Those notifications can be sent to you, or they can be used to trigger other processes, such as AWS Lambda functions. \n",

Unlike other Aamzon S3 storage classes, which store data in a minimum of three availability zones, this selection stores data in a single availability zone.
