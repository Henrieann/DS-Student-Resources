# DSO107 Introduction to Big Data

**Course Description:** The Introduction to Big Data course introduces students to Big Data on a conceptual level and gives students exposure and practice with several skills and tools currently in use.  These skills will be taught at a manageable level, and then broadening methods will be used to help students grasp the meaning and popularity of analyzing substantial amounts of data.  Students will learn the foundational concepts of Big Data and will know how to move from Big Data basics to more business-specific needs and requirements.
