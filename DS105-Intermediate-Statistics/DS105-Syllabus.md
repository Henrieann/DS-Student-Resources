# DS105 Intermediate Statistics

Course Description: The Intermediate Statistics course is designed to teach students about hypothesis testing under multiple scenarios.  Students will be able to determine which hypothesis test to utilize and then be able to perform that specific test.  Students will also learn to identify and verify the data requirements for each hypothesis test.

## Final Project:

Conduct hypothesis tests on the data supplied. For each test: explain the research taking place and include any graphs that make sense, state the null and alternative hypotheses and include the value of the test statistic and the p-value, and complete the analysis by stating the conclusions in terms of the problem presented (not in mathematical terms).  Present results in a manner that encourages understanding of the completed processes by people without any statistical background.
